2.1.13 Deck sort. Explain how you would put a deck of cards in order by suit (in the
order spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds) and by rank within each suit, with the restriction
that the cards must be laid out face down in a row, and the only allowed operations are
to check the values of two cards and to exchange two cards (keeping them face down)

You can perform insertion sort and define your compareTo function such that it checks for suit ordering first,
and if suits are same, then it checks rank.
Example:
You check cards 1,2. If compareTo < 0, exchange
You check cards 2,3. If compareTo < 0, exchange, 3,2. Check "new 2". If compareTo <0, exchange "new 2" and 1
