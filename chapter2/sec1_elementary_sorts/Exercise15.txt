2.1.15 Expensive exchange. A clerk at a shipping company is charged with the task of
rearranging a number of large crates in order of the time they are to be shipped out.
Thus, the cost of compares is very low (just look at the labels) relative to the cost of exchanges (move the crates).
The warehouse is nearly fullâ€”there is extra space sufficient
to hold any one of the crates, but not two. What sorting method should the clerk use?


Selection sort. Moving the crates is expensive which means Insertion sort would be very costly because it would require
shifting crates each time the index moves backwards to check.

The clerk can check compare each crate and remember the location of the minimum for each index pass. Move the minimum to the empty
space. Move the first to the space of the old one and move the minimum to the first, recreating the empty space.
He can repeat this process multiple times. This will result in at most 3 moves for each pass
(1 to move min to empty space, 1 to move first to space of min, 1 to move min to first space)

Insertion sort for any large N will require movement of each crate to the right to insert the minimum on that pass to its rightful postion.
Much more costly.
