2.1.6 Which method runs faster for an array with all keys identical, selection sort or
insertion sort?

Insertion sort will run faster. Selection sort needs to traverse the list to look for minimum elements
as it crosses each index (N searches, N-1 searches, N-2 searches etc.)
Insertion sort will traverse the list, compare the index at each value to its previous, realize it is equal and
move on to the next element.
For this case: Selection sort order of growth is O(n2/2), and insertion sort order of growth is O(n)
