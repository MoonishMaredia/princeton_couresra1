2.4.11 Suppose that your application will have a huge number of insert operations, but
only a few remove the maximum operations. Which priority-queue implementation do
you think would be most effective: heap, unordered array, or ordered array?


Depending on the size of array and frequency of insert and maximum operations, the unordered array
will be optimal. The unordered array has a constant time to insert (i.e. can keep inserting at the end).
However, it has a linear time to search for the maximum.

The heap requires log time to do both. I can imagine a scenario where the unordered array is superior for
the right combination of insert and remove max operations.
