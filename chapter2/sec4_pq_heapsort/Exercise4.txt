2.4.4 Is an array that is sorted in decreasing order a max-oriented heap?

null 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0


               10
          9             8
     7         6     5      4
 3      2   1     0


 Yes a reverse sorted array would be an example of a max oriented heap. It satisfies the
 condition that the parent is larger than each of its two children nodes.
 10 is greater than 9 and 8
 9 is greater than 7 and 6
 8 is greater than 5 and 4
 7 is greater than 3 and 2
 6 is greater than 1 and 0
