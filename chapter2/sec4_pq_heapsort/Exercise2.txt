2.4.2 Criticize the following idea: To implement find the maximum in constant time,
why not use a stack or a queue, but keep track of the maximum value inserted so far,
then return that value for find the maximum?


This will work the first time the maximum value is returned.
When you pop the max and are asked to return the max again, you do not know what maximum
value is any longer and need to iterate through the stack/queue which would cost linear time every time.
