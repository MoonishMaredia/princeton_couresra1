2.4.12 Suppose that your application will have a huge number of find the maximum
operations, but a relatively small number of insert and remove the maximum operations.
Which priority-queue implementation do you think would be most effective: heap,
unordered array, or ordered array?


You want to use heapsort. To find the maximum you need linear time in both ordered and unordered cases.
Heapsort can do it in logn time.
