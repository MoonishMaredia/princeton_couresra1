2.3.8 About how many compares will Quick.sort() make when sorting an array of
N items that are all equal?

If all keys are equal, the partitioning item will also end up in the first position, then
at the second position, then third...
For first position, this will mean N-1 comparisons, then N-2 comparisons...
This should converge to N(N-1)/2 compares when all items are equal
