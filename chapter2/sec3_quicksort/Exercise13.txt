2.3.13 What is the recursive depth of quicksort, in the best, worst, and average cases?
This is the size of the stack that the system needs to keep track of the recursive calls. See
Exercise 2.3.20 for a way to guarantee that the recursive depth is logarithmic in the
worst case

1. In the worst case, you reduce the array by only 1 element each time. This would require N-1 recursive calls to fully sort the array.
This it the worst case.
2. The best case is if you split the array in exactly half each time. This would be logn recursive calls guaranteed.
3. In the average case, as long as you split the array close to half each time, you will have ~logn recursive calls.
