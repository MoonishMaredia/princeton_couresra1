3.1.13 Which of the symbol-table implementations in this section would you use for
an application that does 10^3 put() operations and 10^6 get() operations, randomly
intermixed? Justify your answer

On average, the put operations are equally as costly between the linked and Binary Ordered
structures. However, for ordered structures, the get operations are logN whereas they are
linear for the linked operations
