3.3.22 Find a sequence of keys to insert into a BST and into a red-black BST such that
the height of the BST is less than the height of the red-black BST, or prove that no such
sequence is possible.

Such a sequence exits:
4 3 6 2 5 7

Key insight - given the constraints of self-balance for the tree, you can have instances where passing of links
up the tree forces a split at the root resulting in an increase in height that wouldn't otherwise occur for a standard BST

Standard BST:
           4
        3     6
       2     5  7

Red Black BST:
           6
          //  \
         4      7
        / \
       3   5
      //
     2
