3.2.4 Suppose that a certain BST has keys that are integers between 1 and 10, and we
search for 5. Which sequence below cannot be the sequence of keys examined?
a. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5
b. 4, 10, 8, 7, 53
c. 1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 6, 5
d. 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 5
e. 1, 2, 10, 4, 8, 5



B) contains integer greater than 10. (??? Think this needs to be 53)

D) cannot be true because 3 is within 7's left subtree and all following elements should be less
than 7. However, the tree contains an 8
