3.2.3 Give five orderings of the keys A X C S E R H that, when inserted into an initially
empty BST, produce the best-case tree.

A, C, E, H, R, S, X

                    H
                C       S
              A  E    R   X



Balanced Binary search tree such that nodes to the left of the root is less than the root and nodes
 to the right of the root is greater. This is also true for the subtrees
